# Collaborative Software Development

How to share ideas, algorithms and code with colleagues at work? Ask yourself, how much you want to share? Even beyond, what do your work colleagues think about sharing with you? These are fundamental thoughts for effective collaborative software development and there are mechanics to collaborate in this competitive world after all.

By establishing rules, we can get more perchs of working with other people. Here is some literature in my journey to learn the mechanisms that will drive a code of conduct.

Scipy code of conduct [here](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/doc/source/dev/conduct/code_of_conduct.rst) inspired in [this](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct) document in addition to others.
