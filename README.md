# Collaborative Software Development

How to share ideas, algorithms and code with colleagues at work? Ask yourself, how much you want to share? Even beyond, what do your work colleagues think about sharing with you? These are fundamental thoughts for effective collaborative software development and there are mechanics to collaborate in this competitive world after all.

Scipy code of conduct [here](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/doc/source/dev/conduct/code_of_conduct.rst) inspired in [this](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct) document in addition to others.
